## Description
```
In this project we are going to work on perspectives in Deep Learning for Wildlife monitoring. The project is interdisciplinary and involves the study of animal ecology as well as computer science. Traditionally, the wildlife is monitored with the help of human field workers for counting the animals, patrolling the forests areas or using the camera traps. Nowadays, the data from the different sources is too large to incorporate the human force. So, we believe in such scenario a Deep Learning model could solve the problem. The model itself will maintain more accuracy than the humans as well as it will also do this in lesser time. This will help to fight against illegal poaching of endangered species, preserve the biodiversity and monitor other activities in the animal world. With the help of this project we aim to unleash the power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning to have the better understanding of the animal world.
